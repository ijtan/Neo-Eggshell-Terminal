#Welcome to Egg Shell!
##Introduction
In this project I will be attempting to create a mini shell, from which I can execute external commands,
execute internal commands, interact with environment Variables (create/retrieve).

## Execution

To execute simply Run neoEggshell from the /build/ folder

```
./neoEggshell
```

## Internal Commands

```
- echo
- unset <variable name>
- MYVAR=MYVALUE (for setting environment variables).
- showenv
- listproc
- <command 1> | <command 2> | ... (Piping)
- <command> * filneame (Redirects where * = ['>'/'>>'/'<'])
```
